POSIX Shell And Utilities

Project Description

This application demonstate working of POSIX shell and enviroment variables.
When you download the app, you must get the folder with executable file that
works with console. The output of this program is a meaning of enviroment
variable MY_VAR that I have set with value "Hello world!"

In addition to, I have made some bash scripts that make difference targets:
move all header files to my-header directory, looking for first 20 occurrences
of the string in *.c files, output all extensions in directory. What is more,
I made the script that can change var value in txt file. So... You can see these
in this project.

What the folders contain?

bash - dir with all bash scripts. Also there is README where you also can know how to install
    app. And there is some tips for developers.
src - dir with *.c files
